      <li>2 leeks, washed and chopped</li>
      <li>50g/2oz butter, plus 25g/1oz for dotting on top of the pie</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
      <li>100g/3½oz raw king prawns</li>
      <li>50g/2oz frozen peas</li>
      <li>1 tbsp finely chopped parsley</li>
      <li>1 unwaxed lemon, finely grated zest only</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Boil potatoes until tender. Drain and mash them with the butter, crème
        fraîche and warm milk and season with salt and pepper. Set aside and
        keep warm.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat the milk in a large pan, then add the smoked haddock and cod. Cut
        the onion in half, make an incision in one of the halves and insert the
        bay leaf. Push the cloves into the same onion half and place this into
        the pan with the milk and fish. Bring the milk to the boil, then reduce
        the heat and simmer gently for 6–7 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Meanwhile, finely chop the remaining onion half and the leeks. Heat the
        butter with the olive oil in a small frying pan and gently fry the onion
        and leeks for 4–5 minutes, until softened but not browned.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Remove the fish from the pan, and set aside to cool slightly. Keep the
        milk in the pan.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add the flour to the leeks and stir well. Fry for 1 minute, stirring
        frequently. Gradually spoon in the milk from poaching the fish, and stir
        it in well each time. Add all the milk in this way, and heat gently
        until the sauce has thickened. Taste the sauce for seasoning, and add
        more salt or pepper if necessary.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Break the fish into chunks, being careful to feel for any bones and
        remove any skin, then fold the fish pieces into the sauce. Add the raw
        prawns and frozen peas to the mixture.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place an ovenproof pie dish onto a baking tray (this will catch any of
        the mix that bubbles over when cooking). Spoon the fish mixture into the
        bottom of the dish. Sprinkle the parsley and lemon zest over the top.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Carefully top with the cooled mashed potato. Use a fork to spread the
        mash over the pie and create a rough texture on top. Dot the pie with
        the remaining half of the butter and place in the oven for 25–30
        minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling.
      </li>
    </ol>
