    <p>
      This chicken pie is unbeleekable - Well, it tastes much better than my
      puns at least...
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 medium leeks, washed, trimmed and thickly sliced</li>
      <li>4 skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
      <li>150ml white wine</li>
      <li>150ml chicken stock, hot</li>
      <li>142ml carton double cream</li>
      <li>Sprigs fresh tarragon, leaves picked and roughly chopped</li>
      <li>375g pack ready-rolled puff pastry</li>
      <li>1 medium egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and
        leeks and cook for 4-5 minutes until softened.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add the chicken pieces and cook, stirring, for another 4-5 minutes. Stir
        in the garlic, add the wine and bubble away until reduced by two-thirds.
        Pour in the stock and simmer until reduced by half. Add the cream and
        tarragon, bring to the boil, then simmer for 5-6 minutes until
        thickened. Season, then spoon into a 2.5-litre pie dish (or 4 x 300ml
        ovenproof dishes). Set aside to cool.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Brush a little water along the edge of the pie dish or dishes. Unroll
        the pastry and cut out a piece large enough to cover the dish or dishes.
        Press down the edges and trim off the excess. Snip a small hole in the
        centre of the pastry to let the steam escape. Put on a baking tray and
        chill for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220°C/fan200°C/gas 7.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Beat the egg with a little salt, then brush over the pastry. Bake for
        40-45 minutes (20-25 minutes if you are making individual pies) until
        the pastry is golden.
      </li>
