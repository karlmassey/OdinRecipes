My first completed project following the guidelines set by The Odin Project - this involved creating a basic recipe website to practice my HTML skills. This was then revisted and styles added in order to practice CSS.

None of these recipes or photos belong to me - I wish I was that good at cooking, but unfortunately everything I cook ends up charred...
